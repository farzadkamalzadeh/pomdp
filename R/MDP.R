#' Define an MDP Problem
#'
#' Defines all the elements of a MDP problem and formulates them as a POMDP
#' where all states are observable.
#'
#' The MDP is formulated as a POMDP where all states are completely observable.
#' This is achieved by defining one observation per state with identity
#' observation probability matrices.
#'
#' More details on specifying the parameters can be found in the documentation
#' for [POMDP].
#'
#' @param states a character vector specifying the names of the states.
#' @param actions a character vector specifying the names of the available
#' actions.
#' @param transition_prob Specifies the transition probabilities between
#' states.
#' @param reward Specifies the rewards dependent on action, states and
#' observations.
#' @param discount numeric; discount rate between 0 and 1.
#' @param horizon numeric; Number of epochs. `Inf` specifies an infinite
#' horizon.
#' @param terminal_values a vector with the terminal values for each state.
#' @param start Specifies in which state the MDP starts.
#' @param max logical; is this a maximization problem (maximize reward) or a
#' minimization (minimize cost specified in `reward`)?
#' @param name a string to identify the MDP problem.
#' @return The function returns an object of class POMDP which is list with an
#' element called `'model'` containing a list with the model specification.
#' [solve_POMDP()] reads the object and adds a list element called
#' `'solution'`.
