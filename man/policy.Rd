\title{Extract the Policy from a POMDP/MDP}
\usage{
policy(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A solved \link{POMDP} object.}
}
\value{
A list with the policy for each epoch.
}
\description{
Extracts the policy from a solved POMDP/MDP.
}
\details{
A list (one entry per epoch) with the optimal policy.
For converged, infinite-horizon problems solutions, a list with only the
converged solution is produced.
The policy is a data.frame consisting o:
\itemize{
\item Part 1: The value function with one column per state. (For MDPs this is just
one column with the state).
\item Part 2: One column with the optimal action.
}
}
\examples{
data("Tiger")
sol <- solve_POMDP(model = Tiger)
sol

# policy with value function, optimal action and transitions for observations.
policy(sol)
}
